    "# The Comets Python Toolbox\n",
    "\n",
    "The Comets python module is intended to offer a programatic, easy and intuitive interface to `COMETS`. While it internally uses the same `COMETS` Java engine as always, it replaces the legacy parameter files, simulation layouts or models, bash scripts and output files, by python objects in a single environment, which users deal with to perform simulations and analyze the results. \n",
    "\n",
    "Any comets simulation starts from a **layout** and a set of **parameters**. The layout specifies the environment (media metabolites, refresh values, periodic dilutions) and the species present in it, that is, the **models**. The parameters specify many simulation characteristics, such as number of iterations, timestep, type of metabolite exchange or whether to record different output logs. Therefore, the two main types of objects are `layout` and `params`. These two are passed to the `comets` class, which perform simulations and contain their output. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will walk through the basic functionalities of `COMETS` using the Python Toolbox, and more specific examples of usage will be provided in the next sections. \n",

    "### Preparing a model for `COMETS`\n",
    "The class `model` is used to store the genome-scale metabolic models used in `COMETS` simulations. Most frequently, we will first load a model using `COBRAPy`. Then, we can pass it to the `COMETS` `model` class, which allows us to change `COMETS`-specific model parameters, such as initial population sizes.  "
